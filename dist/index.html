    <h1>frequency-band-visualiser</h1>
    <p>The diagram above uses colour to represent the frequency content of an audio file: sub-bass is red, high-treble is transparent violet and the rainbow spectrum represents all the colours inbetween. You can scroll using a trackpad to interact with it, exploring the waveform with varying scale and precision.</p>
    <p>It may also be used as an audio player, click anywhere on the diagram to drop the needly at that point.</p>

    <p>The code for this demo is open source and can be found on GitHub:</p>
